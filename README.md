## Activities

### Lab Activity 1: Variables and Control Flow
Objective: Introduce variables, data types, and control flow statements in Python.

1. Declare two variables, `num1` and `num2`, and assign them with integer values.
2. Write a program that checks if `num1` is greater than `num2` and prints the result.
3. Use an `if-else` statement to determine if the values of `num1` and `num2` are equal or not, and print an appropriate message.
4. Prompt the user to enter a number and store it in a variable.
5. Use a loop to print all the numbers from 1 to the user-input number.

### Lab Activity 2: Functions and File Handling
Objective: Introduce functions and basic file handling operations in Python.

1. Write a function that takes two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and returns their sum.
2. Create a text file named "numbers.txt" and write a few numbers, each on a new line.
3. Write a function that reads the numbers from the file and calculates their average.
4. Implement a function that takes a string as input and writes it to the end of the "numbers.txt" file.
5. Call the functions and print the results.

### Lab Activity 3: Lists and Basic Algorithms
Objective: Introduce lists, basic algorithms, and list manipulation in Python.

1. Create a list of integers containing at least 10 elements.
2. Write a function that takes the list as input and returns the maximum and minimum values.
3. Implement a function that reverses the order of the elements in the list.
4. Write a function that searches for a given value in the list and returns its index.
5. Implement a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with only the even numbers.
